Hi,

I have an issue with the pressure record of an ADCP time series that I recorded recently with a moored 75 kHz unit. As far as I can tell, the pressure time series is off by a factor of about 25. When I scale the pressure time series by this factor, it correlates well with a pressure record from an instrument higher up on the same mooring, which lets me conclude that the sensor itself seems to be working fine. I am wondering if the instrument has the wrong coefficients stored for the pressure sensor. I compared the output of ps0 with a record from the same instrument from 2015 and the coefficients of the pressure sensor differ quite a bit, see the output below. Do you have any suggestions for how to proceed?

Thanks!
Gunnar
